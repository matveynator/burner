# Arduino Uno/Mega Heater Stove Controller for Oil/Diesel with GSM/SMS
### Designed by Vadim Portnov and Friends

Fully automated burner for used oil with SMS notifications developed by [Vadim Portnov and Nikolay Lobanov](http://portnov.kmv.ru). Works simply and reliably, like an iPhone, but on Arduino Uno. (Can be adapted for Mega, which is even better due to more memory for SMS commands or other features.)

Accepts used oil, regular oil, fuel oil, mazut, furnace/pyrolysis fuel, diesel, and anything that can burn.

Stable version created in 2016 :) [v1.33 for UNO - download](https://github.com/matveynator/burner/archive/refs/tags/uno.zip)

Burner concept and assembly by Vadim Portnov, programming by Matvey Gladkikh, PCB and electronics by Uncle Kolya (Nikolay Lobanov).

Feel free to use it. The burner and program implement many interesting ideas and error protections, ensuring reliable operation. Send your schematics and developments to matveynator@gmail.com - I'll add them to the repository so people can etch PCBs and create quality heating for themselves.

Visit the ready-made used oil burner website at [portnov.kmv.ru](http://portnov.kmv.ru) - where you can buy a ready-made burner with an improved program by Uncle Kolya (Nikolay Lobanov).

Don't forget to thank Vadim and Uncle Kolya for allowing the publication of this old version for the benefit of everyone who wants to create quality heating independently.
